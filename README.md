🛡️ LiveGate - Real-Time Deepfake & Fraud Gatekeeper
LiveGate is a GPT-5 powered security copilot that joins high-value video calls to detect and prevent deepfake impersonation attacks in real-time. It uses dynamic proof-of-life challenges and policy enforcement to stop fraud before money moves.

📖 Overview
Deepfake-driven fraud has become a board-level risk in 2025, with attackers using AI-generated voices and video to impersonate executives and trigger fraudulent payments. LiveGate prevents these attacks during the critical live interaction window by:

🔍 Real-time deepfake detection using multimodal AI analysis

🎯 Dynamic proof-of-life challenges that are impossible to spoof

📋 Policy compliance checking against company guidelines

⚡ Instant transaction blocking when threats are detected

📊 Automated incident reporting and training drill generation

🛠️ How It Works
Joins Calls Securely: LiveGate participates in high-value calls as a verified participant

Analyzes in Real-Time: Processes audio, video, and semantic content using GPT-5

Issues Challenges: Generates context-specific verification questions based on private company data

Enforces Policies: Cross-references requests against company policies and calendars

Blocks Threats: Automatically locks transactions and alerts security teams when fraud is detected
